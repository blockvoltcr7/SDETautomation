MAP

A map contains values on the basis of key, i.e. key and value pair. 
Each key and value pair is known as an entry. A Map contains unique keys.

There are two interfaces for implementing Map in java: Map and SortedMap, and three classes: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.

A Map doesn't allow duplicate keys, but you can have duplicate values. 
HashMap and LinkedHashMap allow null keys and values, but TreeMap doesn't allow any null key or value.


Class				Description
HashMap				HashMap is the implementation of Map, but it doesn't maintain any order.
LinkedHashMap		LinkedHashMap is the implementation of Map. It inherits HashMap class. It maintains insertion order.
TreeMap				TreeMap is the implementation of Map and SortedMap. It maintains ascending order.

*******************

Map.Entry Interface

Entry is the subinterface of Map. 
So we will be accessed it by Map.Entry name. 
It returns a collection-view of the map, whose elements are of this class. 
It provides methods to get key and value.

Method						Description
K getKey()					It is used to obtain a key.
V getValue()				used to obtain value.
int hashCode()				used to obtain hashCode.
V setValue(V value)			used to replace the value corresponding to this entry with the specified value.
boolean equals(Object o)	It is used to compare the specified object with the other existing objects.


******************

HASHMAP

HashMap class extends AbstractMap class and implements Map interface.

Points to remember
Java HashMap class contains values based on the key.
Java HashMap class contains only unique keys.
Java HashMap class may have one null key and multiple null values.
Java HashMap class is non synchronized.
Java HashMap class maintains no order.


*****************

LINKED HASHMAP

Java LinkedHashMap class is Hashtable and Linked list implementation of the Map interface, with predictable iteration order. 
It inherits HashMap class and implements the Map interface.

Points to remember
Java LinkedHashMap contains values based on the key.
Java LinkedHashMap contains unique elements.
Java LinkedHashMap may have one null key and multiple null values.
Java LinkedHashMap is non synchronized.
Java LinkedHashMap maintains insertion order.

*****************

TREE MAP

It provides an efficient means of storing key-value pairs in sorted order.

The important points about Java TreeMap class are:

Java TreeMap contains values based on the key. It implements the NavigableMap interface and extends AbstractMap class.
Java TreeMap contains only unique elements.
Java TreeMap cannot have a null key but can have multiple null values.
Java TreeMap is non synchronized.
Java TreeMap maintains ascending order.


*****************

Java Hashtable class implements a hashtable, which maps keys to values. It inherits Dictionary class and implements the Map interface.

Points to remember
A Hashtable is an array of a list. Each list is known as a bucket. 
The position of the bucket is identified by calling the hashcode() method. A Hashtable contains values based on the key.
Java Hashtable class contains unique elements.
Java Hashtable class doesn't allow null key or value.
Java Hashtable class is synchronized.
