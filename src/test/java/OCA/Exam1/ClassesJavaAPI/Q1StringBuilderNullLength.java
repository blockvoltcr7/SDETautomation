         * The append() method in the StringBuilder class is overloaded with multiple variations, including append(String),
         * append(StringBuffer), and append(char[]), among others.
         *
         * In the given code snippet, the compiler encounters the sb.append(null) statement,
         * where null is passed as an argument. Since null can be interpreted as a String,
         * StringBuffer, or char[], the compiler faces ambiguity in selecting the appropriate append() method.
         *
         * The compiler cannot determine which specific method to invoke because String,
         * StringBuffer, and char[] are not directly related through inheritance.
         * Therefore, the compilation error occurs as the compiler is unable to resolve the ambiguity.
         *
         * To resolve the compilation error, you can explicitly cast null to the desired type.
         * For example, you can cast it to String like sb.append((String) null) or to char[] like sb.append((char[]) null),
         * indicating the intended method to be invoked.
